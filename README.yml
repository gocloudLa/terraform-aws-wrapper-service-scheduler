module_name: Terraform ECS Scheduler Module
module_description: The Terraform Wrapper for Service Scheduler provides the implementation of a lambda function and two event bridge events to handle the scheduled shutdown and startup of various services, an idea for shutting down environments during non-productive hours.

  ```hcl
  service_scheduler_parameters = {
      enable = true # Default: false
  
      power_on_schedule  = "cron(0 11 * * ? *)" # 8AM UTC-3 / null or commented to disable
      power_off_schedule = "cron(0 23 * * ? *)" # 8PM UTC-3 / null or commented to disable
  
      # default_selection_mode = "include"
      # enable_scheduler_ecs   = true   # Default: true
      # enable_scheduler_rds   = true   # Default: true
      # enable_scheduler_ec2   = true   # Default: true
      # cloudwatch_logs_retention_in_days = 14
      # log_level = "INFO"
    }

  ### Operation Details
  #### Resources
  The infrastructure includes the following resources:
  * Main lambda function
  * DynamoDB table
  * Event Bridge Rule (power-off) (optional)
  * Event Bridge Rule (power-on) (optional)

  #### Workflow
  Operation Workflow:
  * **START**<br/>
  The lambda starts with the parameters and verifies if it can execute.<br/>
  (the same action cannot be executed twice in a row)
    * The requested action is persisted in DynamoDB with status (begin).
  * **PROCESS**
    * If **power-off** action is executed:
      * The lambda function performs discovery of services to manage.
      * Persists the current state (prior to power-off) in DynamoDB.
      * Updates the configuration to turn off the services.
    * If **power-on** action is executed:
      * The lambda function discovers the last state of services saved in DynamoDB.
      * Updates the service configuration to match the saved state.
  * **END**<br/>
  The function completes successfully:
    * The requested action is persisted in DynamoDB with status (end).

  ### Configuration Modes (include / exclude)
  **Include Mode** (Default)<br/>
  Variable: `default_selection_mode = "include"`<br/>
  Causes **ALL** services to be included within the application logic for automatic shutdown and startup scheduling, except for services that have the tag `AutomaticScheduler: false`<br/>

  **Exclude Mode**<br/>
  Variable: `default_selection_mode = "exclude"`<br/>
  Causes **ALL** services to be excluded from the application logic for automatic shutdown and startup scheduling, except for services that have the tag `AutomaticScheduler: true`<br/>
